	\opening{HR in HMS,}
	I'm writing to express my interest in the summer job, namely "Mjukvaruutvecklare inbyggda system", posted on your website. I am Embedded \& 
	Intelligent System major. C is the first programming language I learned at school. However, some concept remained unclear, so I had to review 
	them constantly after being exposed to OOP.

	I have implemented IPC and scheduling functionality, a part of kernel, on one ARM platform. In this project, pointer is used heavily, which, kind 
	of, reflects the idea that C is designed to write OS. I have done some concurrent programming in C, using threading and reactive object pattern. 
	Multi-threading is tricky to use; reactive object helps a little bit, but it's still kind of awkward. Maybe some functional programming languages 
	do better in this area.

	I have solid background knowledge working with C projects. Some other programming languages I learned afterward reinforced and strenghed my 
	understanding with C.

	I think I am well suited for this position. Thank you for your consideration.
	\closing{Yours Faithfully}
