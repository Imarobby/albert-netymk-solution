	Project requirement \\
	\begin{itemize}
	%\item
	%The simulation environment must have a graphic interface, where different suggested solutions or improvements can be evaluated.
	%\item
	%The simulation environment must be a copy of the StoraEnso plant in Hylte.
	%\item
	%The simulation environment must have the function to extracting data from the StoraEnso production system database.
	%\item
	%The simulation environment must have the information concerning the reels on each carry.
	\item
	The simulation environment must have the ability to present the user with the total distance based on each truck and all trucks.
	\item
	The simulation environment must have the information based on each reel, such as the total transported distance, the number of movement before it 
	is shipped out, the period of time it spends inside factory.
	\item
	The simulation environment must have the information concerning the usage of all cells with the passage of time.
	\item
	The simulation environment must have the ability to illustrate the trucks' path.
	\item
	The simulation environment must have a graphic interface to illustrate the above information.
	\item
	The simulation environment must keep track of the damaging of reels, such as when the reel was damaged.
	\item
	As for the WHLOCCODE is one capital letter, the simulation software could have the ability to seek the really location by referencing other reels, 
	that share the same order code as this one.
	\item
	The simulation environment could have the ability to present the statistic information of the above variables, such as  total transported 
	distance, the number of movement, etc.
	\item
	More is coming
	%\item
	%The function of extracting data from StoraEnso production system database could be a software.
	\end{itemize}

	\hline
	Prerequisites \\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	The information about StoraEnso production system database, such as how the data is gathered, and the platform this database is using.
