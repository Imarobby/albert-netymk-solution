	Background \\
	\\
	Large quantities of paper are produced and shipped every day at a paper mill. Several trucks are involved to handle all these materials. 

	The situation is explained subsequently:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Paper reels are produced and coming out on a conveyor belt.
	\item
	From conveyor belt they are transported to intermediate storage or to immediate shipping area.
	\item
	From intermediate storage they are later transported to shipping area(container, train, lorry).
	\end{enumerate}
	\\

	\hline
		Objective \\
		\\
		To develop a presenting and simulation environment to test techniques that can be used optimize the material handling. \\
	
	\hline
		Goal \\
		\\
		To convey information from the database, in order to do the further optimization.\\

	\hline
		Limitation \\
		\\
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		Possible optimization approach will not be proposed or simulated.
		\item
		The NEWWHLOCCODE or OLDWHLOCCODE of data have to be among the 180 places, otherwise we will not process them.
		\item
		The reel damaging reason is not presented.
		\item
		The factory map will not be exactly presented, for we are just trying to convey the tracks of trucks. How the factory is constructed is not 
		the point. Therefore, we will simplify the process by plotting each cell as one cell.
		\item
		The distance will be presented with center meter precision.
		\end{enumerate}
