This article demonstrates a basic set of LaTeX formatting commands.
Compare the typeset output side-by-side with the input document.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The ``enumerate'' environment numbers the list elements, like this.

Items in a list can contain multiple paragraphs.
These paragraphs are appropriately spaced and indented according to their
position in the list.
  \item The ``itemize'' environment sets off list items with ``bullets'',
like this. Finally, the ``description'' environment lets you put your own
    
    \item[A] label on each item, like this ``A''.
    \item[If the label is long,] the first line of the item text will
be spaced over to the right as needed.
\end{enumerate}
